📊 Machine Learning for Risk & Behavioral Analytics

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for risk prediction and behavioral analytics using a large, structured customer churn dataset.
The objective is to identify behavioral drivers of churn, benchmark predictive models, simulate risk-scoring use cases, and segment customers based on behavior, while maintaining governance, reproducibility, and responsible AI considerations.
This is an individual portfolio project, designed to reflect real-world, enterprise-style ML workflows rather than purely academic experimentation.

________________________________________
📂 Dataset

•	Public Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)

•	Provided with predefined training and test datasets

•	Large-scale structured data (~440,000+ records)

The predefined train–test split was preserved throughout the project to simulate real-world deployment conditions and prevent data leakage.

🔄 Methodology

1️⃣ Data Loading & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

•	Loaded governed training and test datasets separately

•	Verified data structure, scale, and data quality

•	Analyzed churn distribution to understand class imbalance

•	Identified key behavioral and operational signals, including:

o	Usage Frequency

o	Tenure

o	Support Calls

o	Payment Delay

o	Total Spend

These features were analyzed against churn outcomes to understand behavioral risk patterns.

________________________________________
2️⃣ Enterprise-Style Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

•	Removed non-predictive identifier fields (e.g., CustomerID)

•	Defined categorical and numerical feature groups

•	Applied:

o	One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables

o	Standard Scaling for numerical features

•	Built preprocessing using ColumnTransformer

•	Integrated preprocessing into scikit-learn Pipelines

Pipelines ensured preprocessing was fitted only on training data, preventing data leakage and supporting reproducibility.

________________________________________
3️⃣ Model Training & Benchmarking

•	Trained and benchmarked multiple models:

o	Logistic Regression (baseline)

o	Random Forest (non-linear)

•	Used Stratified Cross-Validation

•	Evaluated models using ROC-AUC, suitable for imbalanced churn data

•	Adjusted model complexity and cross-validation folds to balance:

o	Computational efficiency

o	Evaluation rigor

The best-performing model was selected for downstream analysis.

________________________________________
4️⃣ Risk Scoring Simulation

•	Applied the final model to unseen test data

•	Generated churn probabilities using predict_proba

•	Converted probabilities into risk bands:

o	Low Risk

o	Medium Risk

o	High Risk

This demonstrates how ML outputs can be translated into decision-support risk signals, rather than raw predictions.

________________________________________
5️⃣ Behavioral Segmentation

•	Applied K-Means clustering on consistently preprocessed behavioral features

•	Identified distinct customer segments based on usage, engagement, and interaction patterns

•	Behavioral segments were designed to complement predictive risk scores, supporting richer decision-making

________________________________________
📊 Key Outcomes

•	Identified behavioral patterns strongly associated with churn risk

•	Demonstrated how predictive models and segmentation can support:

o	Customer retention strategies

o	Targeted interventions

o	Risk-aware decision-making

•	Built a scalable, reproducible ML pipeline aligned with enterprise expectations

 
⚖️ Ethics, Bias & Governance

•	Maintained strict train–test separation to avoid data leakage

•	Acknowledged potential bias in historical churn labels

•	Highlighted risks of false positives in customer treatment

•	Emphasized human-in-the-loop decision-making

•	Positioned risk scores as decision-support tools, not automated actions

•	Documented assumptions and limitations transparently
